# Situational Awareness

- Oak Creek Valley’s recreation areas, are a desirable destination of several natural areas accessed by the public Oak Creek Road and its feeder neighboring roads.

    | Recreation Area | Access |
    | :-------------- | :----- |
    | Fitton Green Natural Area | Panorama and Cardwell Hill Road parking |
    | Bald Hill Natural Area | Oak Creek Road, fairgrounds, and Reservoir Road parking |
    | Mulkey Ridge Trail to Bald Hill Farm | No parking, access off Wynoochee Drive |
    | Crestmont Land Trust | No parking, accessed thru Fitton Green |
    | McDonald Research Forest | Oak Creek Road parking |

- The use by ever increasing numbers comes with multiple safety issues, and negative impacts to the environment and hosting residents.
    - Safety concerns range from unsafe walking/cycling to fire response & evac
    - Environmental issues include road-kill, out of parking area off-road damage, unnecessary CO2, and  increased fire risk e.g., hot cars in grass, cigarettes, etc.
    - Hosting residents feel affects of all issues; safety, environmental and lifestyle impacts like comfortably walking to mailbox, being agile enough to get out of the way of speeding cars, pollution , noise.  Some have lost why they moved to the country explicitly e.g., being able to safely ride their horse thru neighborhood.
- A lot change has happened in 20 years – it used to be only a 4-way blinking light at the entrance to Oak Creek Valley.  What have you noticed?
- There is a natural carrying capacity of parking and traffic to trailheads and that is increasingly is exceeded.   The current direction is unbridled impact.

# Path Forward

- The OCVSAG of concerned citizens has taken the goal to address the problems associated with non-managed overuse that  pushes beyond the natural carrying capacity of trailheads. 
- The Oak Creek Valley Community’s initial objective of more fire evacuation routes is under way.  Leadership Ann Eissinger.
- OCVSAG will take a positive stance with stakeholders by offering solutions to cited problems, supports trailhead multi-mode access, and will work to have implemented managed  predictable access protocol for decades to come.
- Safety is paramount.  It takes many forms for residents and visiting recreationists including planning for fire evacuation in an emergency.

1. Ensure primary stakeholders record our concerns & solutions for further discussion and inclusion in their plans
    - Corvallis City, Benton County, OSU College of Forestry
2. Offer solutions to mitigate as many of the concerns as efficiently as possible.  Some solutions may include:
    - Promote access through hiking and cycling.  Supplement parking with shuttle service .
    - “Know before you go” –offer known parking status prior to driving up Oak Creek Road
    - Enforce current rules of use, e.g., citations for parking out of parking area or after hour use
3. Partner with stakeholder groups to develop Oak Creek Valley as a demonstration area of best practices to be a template for other locations in the future.
    - User groups; e.g., school children, mountain bikers, hikers, dog owners, hikers etc.
    - Ensure that original plans for natural areas that supported improving the environmental and safety concerns are adhered to.
    - Work with Oregon Dept. of Forestry, Corvallis Fire Department and the Corvallis Rural Fire District for improving fire response and evacuation plans.
