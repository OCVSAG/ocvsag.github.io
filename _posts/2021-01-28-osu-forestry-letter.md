Hello, I am J### T### representing a group of citizens that live in the neighborhoods along Oak Creek road beyond 53rd street, the Oak Creek Valley Safety Action Group (OCVSAG).   We are requesting meetings with OSU College of Forestry representatives to engage in the conversation described below.  Please respond by February 5th.  We would like to have an introductory Zoom meeting by 2/26/21 with your representatives.

Within the Oak Creek valley canyon area OCVSAG has identified several problems encompassing both safety and environmental issues with the increasing traffic load to trailhead sites.

    * McDonald Research Forest – Oak Creek entrance
    * Fitton Green Natural Area – Panorama and Cardwell Hill entrances
    * Crestmont Land Trust – Panorama and Cardwell Hill entrances
    * Mulkey Ridge Connector Trail – Wynoochee entrance
    * Bald Hill Park – Oak Creek entrance

We have been in contact with the Upper Oak Creek neighbors which worked with your team at the Oak Creek entrance to McDonald Forest: installing bollards, “know before you go” video cams, a simpler turn around to the entrance and ensuring more parking citations are delivered.  We applaud all of your efforts and know that users and residents there have experienced some positive outcomes.  Thank you.

Each of the areas up Oak Creek have similar concerns and prefer to work together as a greater team of the many stakeholders and decision makers to address issues towards a win-win solution-based and enduring manner.  Our hope is that the density of sites can play to the advantage of possible solutions and ideally become a best practice model for responsible management of growing use over time.  OCVSAG has been developing several positive solution alternatives that we would like to share.  We believe that access to wilder lands is an important benefit to our community and thus we do not seek to limit the resource to anyone, but instead deliver a less-damaging solution set acknowledging that there are natural carrying capacities at each site.  For example, Fitton Green’s Panorama entrance has a maximum of nine spaces, zero at Mulkey Creek trail access, and 17 including a disabled space at the beginning of McDonald Forest.  We think that is a workable limit, but a limit. 

We look forward to learning who we can work with from the OSU College of Forestry in the future, to share our specific concerns, brainstorm solutions that affect all sites and learn how to efficiently proceed further.  In partnership, we believe the OSU College of Forestry will be able to use these developments to further improve its community relationship and have a best-case laboratory to foster educational opportunities and interactions between neighbors, recreationists, and other stakeholders.  Similarly, we have requested the same from Benton County (which responded) and the City of Corvallis.

Please reply with the appropriate OSU College of Forestry contact(s) by February 5th.  We would like to have a Zoom meeting for introductory discussions by 2/26/2021.

Sincerely,
